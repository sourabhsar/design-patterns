What is a Adapter design pattern?

Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together.

Used when the client expects a (target) interface.

The adapter class allows the use of the available interface and the Target interface.

Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method
defined by the shared interface.
