What is Abstract Factory Pattern?

It is like a factory but everything is encapsulated:

1) The method that orders the object.
2) The factories that build the object.
3) The final objects.
4) The final objects contain objects that use the Strategy pattern(Composition: Object's class fields are object.)

What can you do with an Abstract Factory?

1) Allows you to create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class.
2) Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime.
3) You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects interact through common interface.
4) The Bad: Things can get complicated.
